# --- Stage 1: Build the React App ---
# Use an official Node.js image (Alpine is lightweight)
FROM node:18-alpine as build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your package.json and package-lock.json
# This path is relative to the build context (frontend/CSA-chatbot)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install all node_modules
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your React app's source code
COPY . .

# Build the app for production (this creates the /dist folder)
RUN npm run build

# --- Stage 2: Serve the App with Nginx ---
# Use a lightweight Nginx image
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine

# Set the port Nginx will run on
EXPOSE 5173

# Copy the built files from the 'build' stage
# from /app/dist (in the build stage) to /usr/share/nginx/html (in the Nginx stage)
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Remove the default Nginx configuration file
RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Create a new config file for our Single Page Application (SPA)
RUN echo "server { \
    listen 5173; \
    location / { \
        root /usr/share/nginx/html; \
        index index.html; \
        try_files \$uri \$uri/ /index.html; \
    } \
}" > /etc/nginx/conf.d/app.conf

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
